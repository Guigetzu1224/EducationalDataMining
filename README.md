Developing a Graduate Recommender System

Notes:
The data fed to this system is a list of students activities, with each activity describing a class the student took and the grade they got. 
The system aims to recommend majors to a student based on their academic history that it believes they will do best in. 
The system is based off of a core-class system, where no classes are used that encode an answer (e.g No class such as Comp Sci 3 as this will encode Computer Science )
